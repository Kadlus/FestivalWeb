        <h2>Taylor Swift</h2>
        <img src="images/taylor_swift.jpg" alt="Taylor Swift"/>
        <p>Taylor Alison Swift (* December 13, 1989, West Reading, Pennsylvania) is an American singer, songwriter,
            composer, multi-instrumentalist, director, and actress. She is one of the most successful singers of the
            early 21st century, and in 2023, she became the artist with the most albums to reach number one in the
            Billboard charts' history. Her success, according to journalists and fans, lies in several key aspects: her
            ability to write song lyrics with emotional stories that listeners can relate to, maintaining a more
            personal relationship with her fans, and her music spanning multiple genres, including country, pop, and
            indie, which appeals to a wide audience.</p>

        <h2>Katy Perry</h2>
        <img src="images/katy_perry.jpg" alt="Katy Perry"/>
        <p>Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson (known professionally as Katy Perry, * October 25, 1984, Santa Barbara, California)
            is an American singer, songwriter, and musician. Born to a pastoral couple, she grew up listening to gospel
            music and sang in church, where she also received her first blue guitar. She rose to fame with her breakout
            megahit "I Kissed A Girl." She is the only female artist in pop history to have five singles from a single
            album, Teenage Dream, reach the top of the U.S. singles chart—a feat previously achieved only by Michael
            Jackson. Perry is also involved in various charitable organizations, including collaboration with UNICEF,
            and is an advocate for LGBT rights and women's equality.</p>
